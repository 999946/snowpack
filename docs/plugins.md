## Overview

There are two types of Snowpack plugins: **build plugins** and **bundler plugins.** Unless you are making a plugin specifically for a bundler like Rollup, Parcel, or webpack, you‚Äôre probably making a build plugin.

## Build Plugins

Build plugins run on single files that pass through Snowpack. They listen for particular file extensions, and when a match is found, transform that code.

In order to keep operations speedy, Snowpack‚Äôs build system is **single pass,** meaning each file is only transformed by a set of plugins once. We‚Äôll talk more about that later.

### The Basics

To create a Snowpack plugin, you may start with the following template:

```js
// my-snowpack-plugin.js

module.exports = function(snowpackConfig, pluginOptions) {
  name: 'my-snowpack-plugin', // plugin name
  input: ['.js', '.ts'], // extensions to listen for
  output: ['.js'], // extensions that will be output
  async build(buildOptions) { /* ‚Ä¶ */ } // code transformations
}
```

A build plugin is a **function** that accepts 2 parameters, in this order:

  1. the Snowpack configuration passed (`snowpackConfig`)
  1. (optional) custom plugin options (`pluginOptions`)

That single function should return an **object** with the following properties:

| Key                |    Type    | Description                                                                               |
|:-------------------|:----------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`             |  `string`  | The plugin name. This will be shown whenever there are errors or messages.                |
| `input`            | `string[]` | An array of file extensions this plugin listens for (e.g. `['.js', '.jsx', '.ts']`)       |
| `output`           | `string[]` | An array of file extensions this plugin may output (e.g. `['.js', '.css']`)               |
| `knownEntrypoints` | `string[]` | Array of npm dependencies this plugin needs to include all of (e.g. `['svelte/internal']` |
| `build()`          | `function` | An async function that takes file info and returns transformed code.                      |

Let‚Äôs look at some examples to see the basics in action:

#### Simple Example

For our first example, we‚Äôll look at transforming files 1:1.

```js
module.exports = (snowpackConfig, pluginOptions) => ({
  name: 'my-commenter-plugin',
  input: ['.js', '.mjs', '.jsx', '.ts', '.tsx'],
  output: ['.js', '.mjs', '.jsx', '.ts', '.tsx'],
  async build({ contents, extension }) {
    return `/* I‚Äôm a comment! */
${contents}`;
  }
})
```

This simple plugin takes all JavaScript & TypeScript files (`['.js', '.mjs', '.jsx', '.ts', '.tsx']`), and prepends a simple comment (`/* I‚Äôm a comment */`) to the beginning of each file. Even though this is a contrived example, it introduces us to the plugin API.

Our plugin **name** is important, as this will appear alongside error messages and/or console output. If you publish a package to npm this should probably be the same name, but you can also run Snowpack plugins from your local repo, in which case this name key is still needed.

The **input** of the plugin is an array of file extensions we want to listen to. Notice we could have only specified `['.js']` if we wanted to, but in our example we wanted to listen for JSX and TypeScript files as well.

The **output** of our plugin tells Snowpack ahead-of-time what filetypes to predict (this lets Snowpack optimize the plugin system without having to wait on each asynchronous plugin to execute). Notice that in this example we‚Äôre not changing the extension, or generating new files, so this is the same as input. In our next example we‚Äôll give an example of when we want this to differ. If you‚Äôre in doubt about this one, you probably just want to mirror `input`.

And lastly, the meat of our plugin lives in `build()`. We took the `contents` of the original file, and added our own comment to the beginning. We then returned the string. Because we‚Äôre only dealing with `.js`, `.mjs`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` files, we don‚Äôt have to check for binary input and can be relatively confident that the file contents we‚Äôre getting is always a string.

Using this example you can add any transformations or utilities within the `build()` function. Notice that when you **return a string** at the end, Snowpack will only apply your transformations on the original file. In our next example, we‚Äôll see how to do complex transformations on multiple files at once.

#### Complex Example

For a more complicated example, we‚Äôll take one input file (`.svelte`) and use it to generate 2 output files (`.js` and `.css`).

```js
const svelte = require("svelte/compiler");

module.exports = (snowpackConfig, pluginOptions) => ({
  name: 'my-svelte-plugin',
  input: ['.svelte'],
  output: ['.js', '.css'],
  knownEntrypoints: ['svelte/internal'],
  async build({ contents, filePath }) {
    const { js, css } = svelte.compile(codeToCompile, { filename: filePath });

    return {
      '.js': js && js.code,
      '.css': css && css.code,
    };
  }
})
```

This is a simplified version of the official Snowpack Svelte plugin, simplified to make the intent clearer.

Let‚Äôs start with the **input**: `['.svelte']`. We‚Äôre only listening for `.svelte` files, however, the **output** has changed: `['.js', '.css']`. Notice that in this example, we‚Äôre returning an object rather than a string. And the object keys `.js` and `.css` match up with `output`. This means that we‚Äôre running the Svelte compiler, and returning the JS and CSS it outputs. We then pass that back as an object to Snowpack.

Say the original input file was `src/components/App.svelte`. Snowpack will then take the object keys and generate 2 files: `src/components/App.js` and `src/components/App.css`. Notice that the filename didn‚Äôt change; only the extension. Snowpack handles that for you, and keeps everything simple.

Also notice that `.svelte` is _not_ in `output`. That tells Snowpack to **delete** the input file, so you won‚Äôt find any `.svelte` files in the build directory. However, if you did want to keep the originals, we could simply add `{ '.svelte': contents }` to the return object to do so.

‚ö†Ô∏è _Note: if your plugin returns different `input`s and `output`s, make sure you‚Äôre not deleting files that other plugins may need!_

#### Complete Build Plugin API

All options available:

```js
module.exports = (snowpackConfig, pluginOptions) => ({
  async build({
    contents, // file contents (could be UTF-8 or binary depending on the file)
    extension, // file extension (e.g. '.js')
    filePath, // complete file path (‚ö†Ô∏è Warning! This may not exist on disk, so don‚Äôt try and perform file operations on)
    isDev, // is this the Snowpack dev server?
  }) {

    /* Option A: transform file 1:1 */
    // return string;

    /* Option B: transform and rename file, or generate other files */
    // return {
    //   '.js': jsFileContents,
    //   '.js.map': jsMapContents,
    //   '.css': cssFileContents'
    //   ‚Ä¶
    // };
  }
})
```

üíÅ Using TypeScript to author your plugin? You‚Äôll find the following import here:

```ts
import type { SnowpackPlugin } from 'snowpack';

const plugin: SnowpackPlugin = () => { /* ‚Ä¶ */ };

export default plugin;
```

### Build your own

#### Local plugin

If you need a local plugin just for your own needs, add it in your `snowpack.config.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    ["../path-to-my-plugin", { optionA: "foo", optionB: "bar" }]
  ]
}
```

#### npm plugin

To release a plugin to npm, take a look at [snowpack-plugin-starter-template](https://github.com/pikapkg/snowpack-plugin-starter-template) which can get you up-and-running quickly.

If rolling your own, however, make sure to mind the following checklist:

- ‚úîÔ∏è Your `package.json` file has a `main` entry pointing to the final build
- ‚úîÔ∏è Your code is compiled to run on Node >= 10
- ‚úîÔ∏è Your package README contains a list of custom options, if your plugin is configurable

### Tips / Gotchas

- Snowpack‚Äôs plugin system is **single-pass** to keep things speedy. That means if you generate a new `.css` file, that file won‚Äôt be run back through another CSS plugin.
- Extensions in Snowpack always have a leading `.` character (e.g. `.js`, `.ts`). This is to match Node‚Äôs `path.extname()` behavior, as well as make sure we‚Äôre not matching extension substrings (e.g. if we matched `js` at the end of a file, we also don‚Äôt want to match `.mjs` files by accident; we want to be explicit there).
- You may have seen a `transform()` function in previous versions of the plugin API. Though that‚Äôll be supported throughout Snowpack `2.x`, it‚Äôs now deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. Instead, please use `build()`.
- The `input` and `output` file extension arrays are the keys to their simplicity. In other plugin systems you have to parse out the filename to determine whether you want to transform it or not. But with Snowpack, you only have to declare file extensions you‚Äôd like to listen for, and Snowpack handles the rest.
- If `build()` doesn‚Äôt return anything, the file isn‚Äôt transformed. In this way you can build pure side-effect plugins if needed.
- If you want to build a plugin that only runs some code on initialization (such as `@snowpack/plugin-dotenv`), put your side-effect code inside your main plugin function to execute when initialized. But be sure to return a `{ name }` so that in case of error, users know what went wrong.

## Bundle Plugin

Snowpack‚Äôs bundle plugin API is less standardized and more prone to change. Chances are if you are authoring a bundle plugin, it‚Äôs for an existing bundler like Rollup or webpack, and we probably want to add it to our officially-supported bundler plugins!

In order to get started, the best way is to study the existing examples:
